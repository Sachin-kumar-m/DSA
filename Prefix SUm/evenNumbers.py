this is another variation to find the even/odd numbers in the given set of ranges.

You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size QÃ—2.

Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].


Explain: to get a solution to this one, we can iterate through the given array and if the index has 
an even number we increment our number and form a prefix array. at any given index of the prefix array
it will give the count of even/odd numbers from 0 to ith index. so to get the even number in the range 
we can use ans[i] = pf[r]-pf[l-1]

Time complexity: O(N+Q), since we are iterating through the given array and also the Q queries
Space Complexity: O(N), we are creating a new array of length N
